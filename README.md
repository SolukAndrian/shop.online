# shop.online
To start my application, you need to download and confugure your apache Tomcat 9.0.0 in your development environment. 

This is simple shop project. Each user logging into my system has ability to register and login. This is done in order to make a purchase. Also, you can login as an administrator, and his opportunities are: removing and adding products and categories, and edit products. If you do not login, you are able to only view the lists of products and categories, and after login, you can add products to basket.
